# Demand-and-Supply
For the task of Demand and Supply analysis, we need a dataset based on demand for a product or service and supply for a product or service. I found an ideal dataset for this task, which is based on the demand for cab rides at a given time and the availability of drivers at a given time.
So there is a constant relationship between the number of drivers active per hour and the number of riders active per hour.
A constant relationship between the number of drivers active per hour and the number of riders active per hour means that for every X number of drivers, there is a consistent and predictable Y number of riders, and this ratio remains constant over time.


Elasticity of demand with respect to the number of active drivers per hour: 0.82
It signifies a moderately responsive relationship between the demand for rides and the number of active drivers per hour. Specifically, this means that a 1% increase in the number of active drivers per hour would lead to a 0.82% decrease in the demand for rides, while a 1% decrease in the number of active drivers per hour would lead to a 0.82% increase in the demand for rides.
This level of elasticity suggests that the demand for rides is somewhat sensitive to changes in the number of active drivers per hour.


Conclusion:-
Demand and Supply analysis means analyzing the relationship between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. It helps businesses understand the factors influencing consumer demand to maximize profits.
